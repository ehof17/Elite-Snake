# üêç Elite Snake

## üöÄ Introduction
Elite Snake is not just your ordinary snake game. Built with React, Express, Node.js, Socket.io, and Vite, it's a vibrant, interactive experience with customizations, special food effects, and a competitive leaderboard. Join the fun at [Elite Snake](http://23.239.5.150:3000/).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is inspired by and based upon Cl√©ment Mihailescu's Snake Game, as featured in his [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Rkib_fvowE) and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Snake-Game-Reverse-LL-Tutorial). While the foundational concepts and initial codebase are derived from his work, this multiplayer edition introduces significant enhancements and features, including:

- **Multiplayer Capability** 
- **Customization:** Allowing players to personalize their gaming experience with custom names and colors
- **Modularity:** Split items into components, and added components like the title screen and leaderboard.
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
- **New Game Mechanics:** Introduction of unique elements like portal foods, adding a new layer of strategy.

This project is meant as a tribute to the original work and an exploration of its potential. It does not replicate the original game in its entirety but rather builds upon it to create a new, unique gaming experience.


## üåü Key Features
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Choose your own snake names and colors.
- **Leaderboard**: Compete to be at the top and track top players.
- **Special Food Items**: 
  - **Reversal Food**: Adds a challenging twist by reversing your snake upon consumption.
  - **Portal Food**: Teleport from one point to another for strategic gameplay.
- **Real-Time Multiplayer Competition**: Play against others in real-time with seamless interactions.

## üíª Technologies Used
- **React**: For a dynamic user interface.
- **Express and Node.js**: Powering the server-side for robust performance.
- **Socket.io**: Enabling real-time communication between players.
- **Vite**: Streamlining the development process.

## üéÆ Play Now
Play online [here](http://23.239.5.150:3000/). Customize your snake, dodge, and teleport to become the leader!

> **Note:** If I ever stop paying to run the server, a legacy single-player experience can be found [here](https://theehofman.github.io/snake2/). This version only has the core gameplay. There are no names, leaderboard, or changing color. Also, it doesn't work on mobile.
